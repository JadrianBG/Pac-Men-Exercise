### To run this project clone the repository to capture files on your machine.  You can drag the HTML document link onto a web browser and use the Add PacMan button to generate PacMan and the Start Game button to start their antics. 
### Roadmap:  I will add speed variations for less random and more controlled pacmen bouncing fun.
### License Info:  This project was created in participation of the MIT xPro Women's Coding Certificate Program. The MIT License applies to all files.
